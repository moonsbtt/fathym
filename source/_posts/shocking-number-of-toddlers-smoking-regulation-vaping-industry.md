title: "Shocking Number of Toddlers Smoking: The Urgent Need for Regulation of the Vaping Industry"

Health Minister Mark Butler has revealed that more than 50 children under the age of four in Victoria alone have ingested nicotine from vapes in the last year. This shocking number highlights the dangers of vaping for children and the urgent need for greater import and enforcement controls to crackdown on the multimillion-dollar industry.

Vaping has exploded in recent years, with the market largely unregulated, leading to a black market that primarily targets children. Despite changes to rules last year that made nicotine vapes only available with a prescription, the industry continues to market to young children with products featuring “pink unicorns on them, bubblegum flavour and such”, according to Mr Butler.

This article will explore the dangers of vaping for children, the tactics used by the industry to market to young children, and the urgent need for greater regulation to protect our children.

## The Dangers of Vaping for Children
Vaping is now the biggest behavioural issue in primary schools across the country. According to Mr Butler, the Victorian poisons hotline has reported that in the last 12 months, more than 50 children under the age of four have had to be reported to the hotline because of the dangerous ingestion of nicotine. This is a very real issue and a threat to all the hard work done over recent decades to stamp out smoking rates.

The use of vapes is particularly dangerous for children, whose bodies are still developing. Nicotine can harm children’s developing brains, which can lead to long-term problems with attention, learning, and impulse control. Furthermore, the e-liquids used in vapes can be lethal for children if ingested. They can cause seizures, coma, and even death.

## The Tactics Used by the Industry to Market to Young Children
Mr Butler has accused the vaping industry of shamelessly marketing not just to teenagers but to young children. The industry is using attractive packaging and flavours, such as “pink unicorns on them, bubblegum flavour and such”, to entice young children to try vaping.

The industry has also created products that look like everyday items, such as highlighters or USB drives, making it easier for children to hide them from parents or teachers. Mr Butler cited an example of a “very young” child who had been found with an “insidious” vape in her pencil case made to look like a highlighter.

## The Urgent Need for Greater Regulation
Health ministers across the country are considering greater import and enforcement controls to crack down on the vaping industry. Mr Butler has said that all options are on the table, including greater import controls and control over sales.

However, one proposal that he won’t consider is that of “normalisation” floated by the Nationals party. The proposal suggests that retailers should be allowed to sell nicotine vaping products, but that sales should be limited to people 18 and over. Mr Butler has rubbished the proposal, saying that we can’t just say it’s too hard and normalize vaping because we know why these products exist. The tobacco industry is pushing these products because they want to create a pathway back to cigarettes.

## Conclusion
The shocking number of toddlers smoking due to ingesting nicotine from vapes is a serious issue. Vaping is now the biggest behavioural issue in primary schools across the country, and the industry is shamelessly marketing to young children with attractive packaging and flavours. The urgent need for greater regulation to protect our children is apparent, and all options, including greater import controls and control over sales, are on the table. We must act now to prevent a new generation of nicotine addicts.
