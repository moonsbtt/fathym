A new study by the University of Michigan reveals that many parents have misconceptions about vaping when it comes to their children. Parents have long relied on their senses to detect whether their children are smoking, including the telltale smell of cigarettes. However, the study shows that vaping is much harder to detect than traditional cigarettes. This article discusses the study's findings and offers some insight into how parents can communicate with their children about vaping.

## Parents' misconceptions about vaping
According to [the study](https://mottpoll.org/sites/default/files/documents/032023_Vaping.pdf), more than 1,300 parents were surveyed, and nearly half of them said that they would be able to detect if their child was vaping. Out of those surveyed, 67% believed that they would know because their child would tell them, and 48% believed that they could detect it by smell. However, lead researcher Sarah Clark believes that there is a problem with this logic. Vaping is not as easy to detect as traditional cigarettes because there is no obvious odor. In fact, vaping is easy to hide from teachers and parents, even when done indoors like bedrooms, bathrooms, and classrooms.

"The smells tend to be minty or fruity, so it honestly can smell like gum or candy," Clark said. As for the idea that children would openly tell their parents about their vaping habits, Clark was extremely skeptical. "The adolescent years are times when kids are experimenting, and they often do that surreptitiously," Clark said.

Nearly 60% of parents who said they would know if their child was vaping said they would be able to tell because they would find “vaping supplies.” However, many kids are using disposable vapes, meaning they do not necessarily bring any supplies home with them. Clark advises parents to open up communication around vaping with their children, as vaping is really quick and convenient and easy to hide, so that just makes it a parenting challenge.

## Curbing vaping among teens
The study also asked parents about ways to curb vaping among teens. 70% said more enforcement of laws against selling to minors would be an effective strategy. 57% said an increase on vape taxes would work, 52% thought limited advertising on social media could and 30% said warning labels on vape packages would be effective.

These findings suggest that parents are concerned about vaping and its potential impact on their children. By understanding the misconceptions about vaping and the ways to curb it, parents can help their children make healthy choices.
