The popularity of vapes has increased rapidly in recent years as people look for an alternative to smoking. While vaping is believed to be less harmful than smoking, there are concerns about the impact of disposable vapes on the environment, as well as the potential risks of counterfeit and non-compliant devices.

Every week, more than 1 million vape devices are thrown into the bins in the UK, which is not only damaging to the environment but also poses a fire risk. Disposable vapes are classified as Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), and should never be disposed of in the bin. When placed in the bin, the batteries can become damaged, leading to fires in refuse vehicles or at waste management sites. Additionally, disposable vapes that are littered on streets break down over time, releasing heavy metals and plastic into the environment.

To tackle this issue, it's recommended that disposable vapes are taken to Raynesway HWRC for recycling. However, investing in a reusable vape kit is a more sustainable choice in the long run.

Another concern regarding disposable vapes is the increase in counterfeit and non-compliant devices being sold in the UK, including to children. In the UK, a disposable vape containing nicotine can have a maximum of 600 puffs, which means that the e-liquid volume cannot exceed 2ml, and it cannot have more than 20mg of nicotine per ml of e-liquid.

Trading Standards have discovered that many nicotine-containing vapes are being sold with much higher numbers of puffs than allowed by regulations. Nicotine is not only addictive but also poisonous, and using non-compliant vapes can be a health risk. Counterfeit vapes have also been found to contain dangerous substances like Arsenic, Lead, and Formaldehyde.

To ensure that you are buying a genuine and compliant vape, it's essential to purchase it from a reputable store and check that the device has the CE, UKCA mark, or both. Spelling errors on the packaging can be an indication of a fake vape.

Councillor Jerry Pearce, Cabinet Member for Streetpride, Leisure, and Public Spaces, commented that while vaping might be better for health, the sale and supply of non-compliant and counterfeit vapes are concerning. When Trading Standards come across these products, they are seized and removed from sale. Additionally, while vaping is viewed as an environmentally friendly choice, millions of disposable vapes that are binned or littered every week contribute to environmental damage. Councillor Pearce encourages residents to choose reusable devices or take disposable vapes to Raynesway for recycling.

In summary, it's crucial to be aware of the impact of disposable vapes on the environment and to avoid purchasing counterfeit or non-compliant devices that can be harmful to health. Investing in a reusable vape kit is an excellent way to reduce waste and ensure that you are using a safe and compliant device.
