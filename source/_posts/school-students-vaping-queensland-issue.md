The use of e-cigarettes or vaping among young people in Australia has become a major concern, with figures showing a significant increase in the past three years. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, e-cigarette use among Australians aged 14 and older has more than doubled between 2016 and 2019, with the highest usage among those aged 18-24. In response to this issue, the Queensland Premier has announced a parliamentary inquiry into vaping, which will focus on the chemicals and ingredients in vapes.

The Queensland Teachers' Union has stated that tackling the problem of vaping among young people requires a whole-of-society approach, rather than just relying on in-classroom education. The union's president, Cresta Richardson, has pointed out that despite the efforts of teachers to educate students and their families about the dangers of vaping, it remains a significant issue in schools across the state.

In this article, we will explore the reasons behind the surge in vaping among young people, the impact of addiction on learning, and the importance of a broad-based approach to address this problem.

The Rise of Vaping Among Young People
According to the Lung Foundation, several factors contribute to the popularity of vaping among young people, including the novelty of the devices, the influence of friends or family members who vape, and the incorrect perception that vaping is relatively harmless compared to smoking cigarettes. With the availability of flavors like mango and strawberry, vaping has become an attractive option for young people. Additionally, affordability is another factor as vapes are much cheaper than traditional cigarettes.

Although the sale of e-cigarettes is restricted in Australia, young people can easily obtain vaping equipment online. Viral online trends involving vapes have become increasingly popular, which has contributed to the rise in vaping among young people.

Addiction Cycle and Learning
Pharmaceutical sciences researcher Selena Bartlett from Queensland University of Technology has highlighted the effects of vaping on learning. She states that addiction to vaping affects the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which controls the ability to say no to ourselves, listen, learn and pay attention. Young people who vape at school are likely to be more distracted and find it difficult to learn.

Bartlett also points out that some children who start vaping can become addicted, while others do it as a result of peer pressure. Addiction affects everyone differently, and those with more stress in their life have a higher chance of becoming addicted to something. The dopamine release in the brain that makes us feel good and drives our motivation to want more is the primary cause of addiction to vaping. With just one puff of a vape, the brain is set up to crave more. Over time, the need for more vapes increases, which is known as the addiction cycle.

A Whole-of-Society Approach
The Queensland Teachers' Union is calling for a broad-based approach to address the issue of vaping among young people. Cresta Richardson has highlighted that schools, parents, and the wider community all have a role to play in educating young people about the dangers of vaping. She believes that managing vaping as a community issue, as has been done with smoking cigarettes, is essential.

Smoking cigarettes has had a response from all levels of government, and the community has responded to it. The education piece around smoking cigarettes for the whole community has been all-encompassing. Richardson believes that there is a place for the same approach with vaping as well.

Conclusion
Vaping among young people in Australia is a significant issue that requires a whole-of-society approach. The popularity of vaping among young people can be attributed to several factors, including the availability of vaping equipment, viral online trends, and the incorrect perception that vaping is relatively harmless compared to smoking cigarettes. Addiction to vaping affects learning, and young people who vape at school are more likely to be distracted and find it difficult to learn. A broad-based approach involving schools, parents, and the wider community is necessary to address this issue.
